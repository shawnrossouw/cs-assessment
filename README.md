## Course Studio Assessment Task.

#### [Project Link](https://cs-assessment.vercel.app/)

### Overview

This is my take on the Course Studio Assessment task. I bootstrapped the project with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
React framework to complete the task. The UI is coded fully responsive and I'm using CSS modules with the PostCSS plugin
for code nesting and component bundling. I went with [Storyblok](https://www.storyblok.com/) as the headless CMS for
content on the project. The animations on the project is mixture between my custom CSS animations and the
[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) library. The slider was built using [Swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com/).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
